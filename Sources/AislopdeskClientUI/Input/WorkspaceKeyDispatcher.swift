// WorkspaceKeyDispatcher — the LIVE keybinding dispatcher (WS-B / B3).
//
// THE re-scope: docs/DECISIONS.md previously recorded "there is no NSEvent monitor — a binding absent from
// the menu is a dead chord" (the ⌘⇧I sync-input note). That rule held while every workspace chord was a
// single ⌘/⌥-prefixed shortcut a SwiftUI `.commands` menu could express. The WS-B prefix engine breaks that
// premise: a tmux/zellij-style MULTI-KEY prefix (e.g. ⌃A then D) cannot be expressed by `.keyboardShortcut`,
// and — more importantly — a `.commands` menu cannot SWALLOW the follow-up key BEFORE the terminal first
// responder (libghostty's `GhosttyLayerBackedView`) sees it, so the second key of a sequence would leak into
// the PTY. Hence ONE app-level `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents(matching: .keyDown)` installed at launch.
// docs/DECISIONS.md is updated to record this re-scope (per CLAUDE.md "update DECISIONS.md when re-scoping").
//
// CONTRACT (the load-bearing rule): a BARE unmodified key MUST pass through untouched — normal typing always
// reaches the PTY/video responder. The monitor only intercepts:
//   • the configured prefix (arm / send-prefix double-tap),
//   • armed-state follow-up keys (resolve a bound chord/sequence, or swallow an unbound one), and
//   • bound single chords (the existing ⌘D/⌘T/… table, override-aware via `resolvedChordTable`).
// Everything else returns the event UNCHANGED so it flows to the focused responder.
//
// PURITY: the NSEvent→`KeyChord` normalization is factored into the pure, AppKit-free `KeyChordNormalizer`
// (mirroring GhosttyTerminalView's `ghosttyMods` + `charactersIgnoringModifiers` for parity) so the chord
// mapping is unit-tested headlessly; the transition logic lives entirely in the pure `PrefixStateMachine`
// (B2). Only the thin NSEvent→intent wiring lives here.
