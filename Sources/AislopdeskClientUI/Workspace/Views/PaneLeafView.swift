// MARK: - PaneLeafView (WF5 — the real content seams per kind)

/// The content of a single leaf pane: the kind switch that wires the PROVEN seams (docs/22 §7),
/// re-parented from "one global session" (the retired `ClientRootView`) to "one per `PaneID`".
///
/// Its SIGNATURE is the stable WF4 contract — only the BODY is WF5:
/// - `.terminal`   → ``TerminalScreenView``(model: handle.terminalModel) + a per-pane
///   ``InputBarView``(model: handle.inputBar, client: handle.connection.activeClient), composed
///   exactly as the old `ClientRootView` did for ONE session.
/// - `.claudeCode` → the same terminal + a TOGGLEABLE ``InspectorPanel`` (per-pane VIEW state — an
///   inspector-visible toggle + a local split ratio; macOS side-by-side, iOS a bottom sheet —
///   mirroring the old `ClientRootView` platform branch). It is a SINGLE leaf, not a tree node.
/// - `.remoteGUI`  → ``RemoteWindowPanel``(model: handle.remoteWindow, showCloseButton: false) — the
///   pane chrome owns close; video decode activates on appear / deactivates on disappear (battery).
///
/// ### Connect-on-appear (docs/22 §6 RESTORED-vs-RECONNECTED, lazy connect)
/// `LivePaneSession.make` builds the `ConnectionViewModel` WITHOUT connecting. This view's `.task`
/// triggers `connect()` ONCE for the visible pane (idle → connecting). It does NOT disconnect on

/// pause/resume is the store's scenePhase fan-out, not a view-lifecycle teardown.

///
/// ### Two reasons admission can be `false` (BUG-A) + the F1 regression fix
/// `activateVideo` (and direct activation) can decline for two very different reasons, which this view
/// MUST distinguish — otherwise an unconfigured pane is stuck forever on a wrong "too many windows"
/// placeholder with no way to enter host/port:
/// - the model is **not yet configured** (`remoteWindow.canOpen == false` — a fresh New-Tab/split
///   Remote Window has `video: nil` → `RemoteWindowModel()` with empty fields) ⇒ show the
///   ``RemoteWindowPanel`` ENTRY FORM so the user can dial in the endpoint (it holds no decode stack
///   until they open it);
/// - the model **is configured** (`canOpen == true`) but the cap is saturated ⇒ show the gated
///   placeholder (and re-attempt when a slot frees, ITEM #2).
///
/// The store's `false` alone cannot tell those apart (`activateVideo` returns `false` for both). So the
/// display is decided by ``RemoteGUIDisplay/resolve(admitted:configured:hasFreeSlot:)`` fed BOTH
/// `configured` (the model's `canOpen`) and `hasFreeSlot` (the store's pure
/// ``WorkspaceStore/hasFreeVideoSlot(for:)`` read mirroring the admission guard): a configured pane with
/// a slot still FREE keeps showing the entry form (F1 — the form must not vanish the instant the
/// endpoint becomes valid), and only a configured pane refused because the cap is genuinely saturated
/// shows `.gated`.
///
/// ### Reactive admission (ITEM #2 + F1)
/// The store cannot flip a pane's liveness itself — admission is view-driven. Two reactive re-attempts:
/// - **F1 — became configured**: a fresh pane's `.onAppear` ran while `canOpen` was still false, so it
///   never admitted. When the user finishes typing a valid endpoint `configured` flips true; this view
///   observes it via `.onChange(of: configured)` and re-runs `activate()` (→ `activateVideo`, still
///   cap-checked) so a configured pane with a free slot goes live without a manual nudge.
/// - **ITEM #2 — a slot freed**: when a slot frees the store bumps
///   ``WorkspaceStore/videoPromotionGeneration``; this view observes it via `.onChange` and re-attempts
///   admission through `activateVideo`, so a previously-gated on-screen pane promotes itself the moment
