///
/// WHY: the flat 12 Mbps live default (doc 18 §E) was MEASURED at 1080p@1×. Feature #1's 2× HiDPI
/// virtual display quadrupled the encoded pixels (a window now captures at points×2, e.g. 2816×1778)
/// but left the budget at 12 Mbps. With the hard `DataRateLimits` cap AND the `MaxAllowedFrameQP`
/// ceiling both binding, a heavy scroll frame could not fit at the ceiling QP → VideoToolbox DROPPED
/// it → the "scroll/content-change not smooth" stutter the user reported (sharpness was already fixed).
/// A dropped frame IS the stutter; the cure is enough bits that motion frames fit.
///
/// WHAT: size the live budget to the ACTUAL encoded pixel throughput (area × fps) at a fixed
/// bits-per-pixel-per-frame density, so any window at any `captureScale` is provisioned proportionally.
/// The configured `--bitrate` acts as a FLOOR (an explicit higher value is still honoured); LAN/NetBird
/// bandwidth is ample, so the resolution-derived value wins for any window from ~1080p up.
///
/// Pure Int/Double arithmetic — unit-tested. (The `VideoEncoder` it feeds is HW-gated and never
/// instantiated in a test; this keeps the bitrate decision headlessly verifiable, mirroring
/// ``VirtualDisplayGeometry`` / ``StaticIDRDecider``.)

    /// (smooth scroll, coarser DURING motion only — natural motion blur), while the crisp static refresh
