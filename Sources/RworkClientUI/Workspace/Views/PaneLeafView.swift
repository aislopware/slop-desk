/// The content of a single leaf pane: the kind switch that wires the PROVEN seams (docs/22 §7),
/// re-parented from "one global session" (the retired `ClientRootView`) to "one per `PaneID`".
///
/// Its SIGNATURE is the stable WF4 contract — only the BODY is WF5:
/// - `.terminal`   → ``TerminalScreenView``(model: handle.terminalModel) + a per-pane
///   ``InputBarView``(model: handle.inputBar, client: handle.connection.activeClient), composed
///   exactly as the old `ClientRootView` did for ONE session.
/// - `.claudeCode` → the same terminal + a TOGGLEABLE ``InspectorPanel`` (per-pane VIEW state — an
///   inspector-visible toggle + a local split ratio; macOS side-by-side, iOS a bottom sheet —
///   mirroring the old `ClientRootView` platform branch). It is a SINGLE leaf, not a tree node.
/// - `.remoteGUI`  → ``RemoteWindowPanel``(model: handle.remoteWindow, showCloseButton: false) — the
///   pane chrome owns close; video decode activates on appear / deactivates on disappear (battery).
///
/// ### Connect-on-appear (docs/22 §6 RESTORED-vs-RECONNECTED, lazy connect)
/// `LivePaneSession.make` builds the `ConnectionViewModel` WITHOUT connecting. This view's `.task`

/// The store cannot flip a pane's liveness itself — admission is view-driven. Two reactive re-attempts:

///   never admitted. When the user finishes typing a valid endpoint `configured` flips true; this view
///   observes it via `.onChange(of: configured)` and re-runs `activate()` (→ `activateVideo`, still
///   cap-checked) so a configured pane with a free slot goes live without a manual nudge.
/// - **ITEM #2 — a slot freed**: when a slot frees the store bumps
///   ``WorkspaceStore/videoPromotionGeneration``; this view observes it via `.onChange` and re-attempts
///   admission through `activateVideo`, so a previously-gated on-screen pane promotes itself the moment
///   a slot opens.
