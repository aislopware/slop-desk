import SlopDeskAgentDetect

// `slopdesk watch:claude <id>` — the PURE exit-code state machine.
//
// `watch:claude <id>` blocks until the named Claude session reaches an at-rest state, then exits.
// Spec (reference__cli.md §CLI): exit `0` = idle or session closed, `4` = session id never seen,
// `9` = timeout. Claude-only — there is no `watch:codex`/`watch:opencode` (carry-over exclusion §4).
//
// The CLI polls the running app's `agent-status` method (``ClientControlProtocol/Method/agentStatus``),
// which answers `{seen, status?}`: `seen:false` = the id resolves to NO pane (→ exit 4); `seen:true` with
// NO `status` = the pane EXISTS but its agent has not reported yet (the startup window → keep polling);
// `seen:true` + a ``ClaudeStatus`` rawValue = the rolled-up agent status. This type turns each polled observation —
// plus whether the id has EVER been seen across polls and whether the deadline has elapsed — into a
// ``Step``: finish with an exit code, or keep polling. The poll loop itself (sleep + socket I/O + the
// clock) lives in `main.swift` (compiled-only — it does I/O and sleeps, so it is never instantiated in
// a unit test, hang-safety rule); ALL exit-code decisions are HERE and exhaustively unit-tested.
