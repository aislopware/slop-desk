// OverlayCoordinator — the single `@MainActor @Observable` owner of the floating-overlay layer's state
// (warp-overlays-actions.md §4: a central reducer the chrome controls dispatch into). Owns:
//   - the command-palette presentation (mode + filter + query) and its mixer,
//   - the Settings open action (injected `openSettings` env action → the stock Settings scene),
//   - the toast stack (wired to the store's onPaneNotification / onLongCommandNotify / onAgentAttention),
//   - and routes a palette row's `PaletteAction` to the store, then closes.
//
// Mounted once at `WorkspaceRootView` in a ZStack above the window. The busy-close modal is driven directly
// off the store's `pendingCloseSpec` — the coordinator owns only palette/settings/toasts.
