// RailRowsMemo — the sidebar's row-model cache (perf audit, Option B memoization).
//
// PROBLEM: `NavigatorColumn`'s body called `RailRowsBuilder.rows(for:)` directly. That walk reads every
// volatile per-pane store dictionary (`paneAgentStatus`, `paneGitSummary`, `panePendingCompletion`,
// `paneForegroundProcess`, progress, gates, read-only, `completionFlashTick`, …). Observation tracks at
// PROPERTY granularity — reading `dict[oneKey]` depends on the WHOLE dict — so ANY pane's status tick
// invalidated the whole sidebar body: a full O(panes) row rebuild + `disambiguated()` + sectioning + list
// diff on the main thread, keystroke-adjacent.
//
// FIX SHAPE: the body asks THIS memo for the rows. The memo compares a STRUCTURAL fingerprint
// (`RailStructureKey` — tab/pane identity + specs + project keys + the A4 title-process fallback) and
// returns the cached array on a match, WITHOUT calling the builder — so a settled body registers NO
// Observation dependency on the volatile dicts and a status tick no longer invalidates it at all. The
// VOLATILE fields the cached rows carry (badge / git line / status / lock / rename mode) are stale by
// design: each row VIEW re-reads its own pane's chrome fresh via `RailRowsBuilder.liveChrome(for:store:)`,
// so a tick re-renders one cheap leaf row body instead of rebuilding the whole model.
//
// Settling: the eval that MISSES (and the first eval ever) calls the builder and therefore registers
// volatile deps — the NEXT volatile tick re-runs the body once, hits the cache while reading only the key's
// structural inputs, and the body settles out of the volatile set. One extra cheap eval per structural
// change; zero per volatile tick thereafter.
//
// Headless (no SwiftUI import) so `RailRowsMemoTests` pins the hit/miss shape without a view.

///   • each pane's full `PaneSpec` (kind, title + `userRenamed`, cwd, `lastKnownTitle`, `railSubtitle` —
