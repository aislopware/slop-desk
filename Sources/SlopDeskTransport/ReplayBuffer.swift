/// Host-side replay buffer for lossless reconnect — an SlopDesk-native port of
/// Eternal Terminal's `BackedWriter` over plain TCP.
///
/// **Pure logic**: no networking dependency, unit-testable in isolation. Retains
/// host→client `output` payloads keyed by a monotonic `Int64` seq until the client
/// acks them, and produces the un-acked tail for replay on reconnect.
///
/// ## Why
/// iOS kills the TCP connection seconds after backgrounding. To resume **byte-exact**
/// without tmux, the host retains sent `output` payloads keyed by their monotonic
/// `Int64` seq; on reconnect the client's `hello.lastReceivedSeq` tells the host which
/// tail to replay (`seq > lastReceivedSeq`). Equivalent to ET's byte-level `BackedWriter`
/// seq, lifted to a **per-message** seq (see `docs/20-wire-protocol.md`).
///
/// **Only `.output` is sequenced and replayed.** Control messages
/// (`resize`/`ack`/`title`/`bell`/…) are lifecycle/metadata, not retained: re-deriving
/// size or re-sending a title on reconnect is cheap and stateless; PTY output is the
/// irreplaceable byte stream.
///
/// ## Caps, gates, and the load-bearing invariant
/// - **`maxBackupBytes` = 256 MiB** (4× ET `MAX_BACKUP_BYTES` — coding-tool hosts are ≥32 GB): retained-byte ceiling we
///   *aim* to stay under.
/// - **`offlineGateBytes` = 64 MiB**: while offline, once retained bytes reach this gate
///   ``shouldPauseDrain`` flips `true` (ET `SKIPPED`); below it the host keeps buffering
///   (ET `BUFFERED_ONLY`).
/// - **INVARIANT — never silently drop un-acked data.** Dropping un-acked output to meet
///   the 256 MiB cap would break byte-exact resume (an unrecoverable client gap), so the
///   buffer **never evicts un-acked entries**. Offline memory is bounded *instead* by
///   ``shouldPauseDrain``: when asserted, the host relay (WF-3) stops reading the PTY, so
///   the kernel PTY buffer backpressures the shell and **no droppable output is produced**.
/// - **INVARIANT — dead-channel send = retain, never throw.** A retained entry is removed
///   only by a client ``ack(upTo:)``, never by a failed wire send. The host relay retains
///   the bytes (``append(bytes:)``) BEFORE sending, so if a live send loses its channel
///   (data channel cancelled mid-flight — POSIX 89) the entry stays retained and is re-sent
///   by the next ``replay(after:)``. This lets the host treat a dead-channel send as
///   "client offline → replay later" with zero byte loss, not a fatal fault.
/// - **Slow-consumer case (online but acking slowly):** if retained bytes exceed
///   `maxBackupBytes` while online, ``shouldPauseDrain`` asserts *anyway* — still no drop;
///   we pause draining until acks catch up. No path discards un-acked output.
///
/// - Seq is **`Int64`** (ET proto2 used int32, which truncates on very long sessions).
/// - **No `CryptoHandler`.** WireGuard already encrypts; the buffer stores raw bytes.
///   Do not reintroduce ET's libsodium secretbox / nonce-reset layer here
///   ([18](../../docs/18-risk-resolutions.md) §H).
///
/// `ReplayBuffer` is a `Sendable` value type: the owning host relay holds it as stored state
/// and mutates it under a lock / actor isolation; the derived ``shouldPauseDrain`` drives the
/// PTY read-loop pause. The pure value type is what makes its invariants exhaustively testable
