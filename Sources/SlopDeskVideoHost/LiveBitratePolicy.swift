/// PURE resolution-aware live-bitrate policy for the HEVC encoder.
///
/// WHY: the flat 12 Mbps live default (doc 18 §E) was MEASURED at 1080p@1×. A 2× HiDPI virtual
/// display quadruples the encoded pixels (a window captures at points×2, e.g. 2816×1778) while the
/// budget stays at 12 Mbps. With the hard `DataRateLimits` cap AND the `MaxAllowedFrameQP` ceiling
/// both binding, a heavy scroll frame can't fit at the ceiling QP → VideoToolbox DROPS it → scroll
/// and content-change stutter. A dropped frame IS the stutter; the cure is enough bits that motion
/// frames fit.
///
/// WHAT: size the live budget to the ACTUAL encoded pixel throughput (area × fps) at a fixed
/// bits-per-pixel-per-frame density, so any window at any `captureScale` is provisioned proportionally.
/// The configured `--bitrate` acts as a FLOOR (an explicit higher value is still honoured); LAN/NetBird
/// bandwidth is ample, so the resolution-derived value wins for any window from ~1080p up.
///
/// Pure Int/Double arithmetic — unit-tested. (The `VideoEncoder` it feeds is HW-gated and never
/// instantiated in a test; this keeps the bitrate decision headlessly verifiable.)

    ///
    /// MOTION-SMOOTHNESS: at 2× the 0.15 density makes a fast-scroll frame balloon to 50–280 KB — a
    /// wildly VARIABLE per-frame transmit/decode time that the client's (no-jitter-buffer) vsync pacer
    /// turns into judder. HW A/B testing shows frame SIZE is the dominant lever: dropping to 1× (¼ the
    /// bytes) makes scroll markedly smoother. This is env-tunable (`SLOPDESK_BPP`) to dial the
    /// smooth↔sharp balance without a rebuild: a LOWER bpp shrinks motion frames toward 1× size (smooth
    /// scroll, coarser DURING motion only — natural motion blur), while the crisp static refresh
    /// (`encodeLiveCrispKeyframe`) restores razor-sharp text the instant the screen goes still. With the
