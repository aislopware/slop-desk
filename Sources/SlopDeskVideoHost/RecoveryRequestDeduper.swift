/// Component 5 (recovery-redundancy, 2026-06-11): host-side dedup window for recovery-request
/// datagrams. The client now sends each logical `requestLTRRefresh` / `requestIDR` as N
/// byte-identical copies spaced ~3 ms apart (``SlopDeskVideoProtocol/RecoveryRequestRedundancy``);
/// this collapses those copies back to ONE host action.
///
/// WHY the host needs it (and the capturer latch alone is not enough): same-frame duplicates
/// dedup via the capturer's Bool latch, but copies STRADDLING a capture-frame boundary re-latch
/// AFTER the drain — on the LTR path (no cooldown exists there) that encodes a SECOND
/// `ForceLTRRefresh` P-frame and resets `framesSinceAnchor`. Even a 6 ms copy spread straddles the
/// 16.7 ms @60fps boundary often, so dedup here is REQUIRED for the LTR path and
/// belt-and-braces for the IDR path (whose `RecoveryIDRPolicy` admission absorbs duplicates too).
///
/// KEY = the FULL raw datagram bytes (type byte + entire body, including the component-2
/// `lastDecodedFrameID` context). Byte-equality means zero coupling to the wire layout: the
/// client encodes ONCE per logical request and re-sends the identical `Data`, so any future body
/// change is covered automatically. A ring (not a single slot) so interleaved bursts (copies for
/// lost frame N interleaving with copies for frame N+1 — different bytes) both dedup correctly.
/// A duplicate does NOT refresh the original's timestamp: a legitimately identical re-request
/// ages back to admissible one `windowSeconds` after the FIRST sighting, never starved by its
/// own copies.
///
/// Native Swift, the single source of truth (no wall clock — the caller injects `now` in seconds).
/// It is a `final class` (not the former value struct) so the host session owns it by reference
/// without a `let`→`var` ripple.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable`: the internal ring is not thread-safe, but every use is single-owner — the
/// host session holds it as an actor-isolated property and the loopback validator / tests drive it
/// from a single thread, so no two threads ever touch it concurrently.
