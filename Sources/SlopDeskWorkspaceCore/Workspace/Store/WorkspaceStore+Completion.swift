/// The B3 "a command finished while you were elsewhere" logic, factored out of ``WorkspaceStore`` so the
/// class body stays under the type-body-length ceiling (like the WB2/WB3 block ops in
/// `WorkspaceStore+Blocks.swift`). The stored state (`panePendingCompletion`, `isAppActive`,
/// `onLongCommandNotify`) lives on the class — `@Observable` synthesises on it; only the methods are here.
///
/// The badge (✓/✗) is set ONLY for an UNFOCUSED pane and cleared the instant it gains focus / the app
/// returns active. The long-command desktop notification is fired through the thin `onLongCommandNotify`
/// sink under the SAME focus gate (so a foreground long command does not spam) — `UNUserNotificationCenter`
/// never enters the store, keeping this whole path headless-testable.
