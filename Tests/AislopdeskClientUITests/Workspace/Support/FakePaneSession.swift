/// and the scenePhase fan-out — **without ever constructing a `AislopdeskClient` or a `HostServer`**.
///
/// Built from a ``PaneSpec`` (mirroring `LivePaneSession.make`'s spec→session shape) so the store's
/// production and test factories are interchangeable. It also conforms to the store-internal
/// ``PaneSessionIDAdopting`` so `reconcile()` re-points its `id` at the leaf id, exactly as it does for
/// the live session — which is what lets the registry-key invariant be asserted.
