// StatusDotTests — pins the trailing status mark, the T3 Code SidebarV2 port. ONE shape (the
// static dashed ring) and the HUE is the whole grammar, the resolver's ladder being the spec: a
// working agent rings on the accent (the same raw-working key liveness uses, outranking every
// badge); a RESTING CODE AGENT rings muted; the attention states ring on their attention ink — the
// title never recolours, so the mark's hue is those states' entire rendering; a plain running
// command, a bare idle shell and privilege-only rows mount nothing. The STATIC contract (nothing
// in the mark animates) rides the geometry pins. Headless VALUE assertions — no render. Ink
// identity is asserted SELF-consistently against the presentation maps (never absolute colour
// values — `Color` equality is provider-fragile).
