# 17 — Best-solution synthesis: lowest latency + "real machine" feel (TUI & GUI per-window)

> **STATUS: CURRENT.** Synthesized from 7 "families" of OSS + commercial solutions to lock the **best** design for the 2 paths, prioritizing (a) lowest latency and (b) the feel of **a local machine**. Corpus: [research/17-tui-gui-best-solution.json](research/17-tui-gui-best-solution.json). Decisions live in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md); this doc is the **why + mechanics**. Philosophy (see [00](00-overview.md)): **one good choice per problem** (one renderer, one structured view, one core).

## TL;DR (headline)

1. **PATH 1 (terminal) is already nearly local** at 5–20ms mesh RTT. Raw VT byte-stream over **plain TCP + `TCP_NODELAY`** + **libghostty external-IO** = full fidelity, no round-trips. **Do NOT build a Mosh shadow-framebuffer predictor for v1** (§2.4). Add **dual data/control channels** + an **ET-style replay buffer** for lossless reconnect.
2. **PATH 2 highest-value decision = client-side cursor rendering**: split the pointer out of the video, send position+bitmap over a separate UDP side-channel, composite client-side at display-refresh → **pointer latency = RTT**, independent of encode/decode. This is the "feels remote" ↔ "feels local" boundary.
3. **PATH 2 sharp text for editor windows**: **lossy-first → lossless-upgrade** (encode at quality ~0.65 and send immediately, re-encode the dirty-rect with `kVTCompressionPropertyKey_Lossless` when idle) — fast, then pixel-perfect once the user stops to read.
4. **PATH 2's hardest risk** was mapping client video-region coords → host window/screen for CGEvent injection (Retina scaling + window moves) — now **SOLVED** ([18 B], §3.9).

| 3 | Open-source GUI (Moonlight/Sunshine, RustDesk, Chrome RD, Selkies) | **Client-side cursor** + LTR/FEC loss recovery + frame pacing |
| 4 | Per-window remoting (RDP RemoteApp, X11, Xpra, waypipe, SCKit per-window) | **Lossy-first→lossless-upgrade** + idle-skip + window-geometry channel |
| 5 | Apple-native (Sidecar, ARD High-Perf, ScreenCaptureKit, VideoToolbox) | 4-flag recipe + NV12 zero-copy + concurrent-session limit |
| 6 | Feels-native cross-cut (prediction, cursor, jitter, pacing, FEC, coalescing) | Technique ranking by impact (§4) |

Every claim verified back to source. **Corrections** (survey wrong → fixed) are marked "⚠️" through §2–§3.

## 2. PATH 1 — Terminal: best design

### 2.1 Transport: raw TCP + `TCP_NODELAY` (mandatory) + dual channels

- Raw PTY byte-stream over **plain TCP** (decided in [13]). **NEW: enable `TCP_NODELAY` right after `connect()`** on every socket. Nagle coalescing of 1-char writes adds **up to 200ms** to echo — the single omission in every terminal stack surveyed. One `setsockopt`, **high** impact.
- **Dual channels**: data channel (PTY bytes) separated from control channel (`TIOCSWINSZ` resize + intent/disconnect). Lesson from Zellij: an output burst must not delay the resize-ack. Low effort. Wire framing + channel mux + per-channel flow control are native Swift (`SlopDeskProtocol` / `SlopDeskTransport`).
- **No-buffer relay** (NoMachine NX): no ring buffer between `posix_spawn`→TCP write; lockless relay, relay thread at **`QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE`**.

### 2.2 Renderer: libghostty external-IO — the truth about the forks

- `ghostty_surface_feed_data` / `ghostty_surface_set_write_callback` **do NOT exist at upstream Ghostty HEAD** (verified: `include/ghostty.h` is 1208 lines, neither present). Only in forks:
  - **`wiedymi/ghostty` branch `custom-io`** — VVTerm ships on this (`scripts/build.sh` clones this ref).
  - **`daiimus/ghostty` branch `ios-external-backend`** — Geistty ships on this; adds `External.zig` (~379 lines) + resize callback + tests.
- Decision ([12]/[DECISIONS]) to **own a minimal patch referencing `daiimus/External.zig`** is confirmed **proven in 2 shipping iOS apps**. `use_custom_io = true` switches termio from `Exec.zig` (PTY) to `External.zig` (no local shell spawn).
- **Data IN**: TCP bytes → `ghostty_surface_feed_data(...)` → `ghostty_surface_refresh` + `ghostty_surface_draw` via a **coalescing `DispatchQueue.main.async` guard** (VVTerm's `scheduleCustomIORedraw`). **Data OUT**: keypress → C write-callback (fires **synchronously on the main thread** from Ghostty's key encoder) → schedule `Task(.userInitiated)` to write to TCP.
- ⚠️ **Mandatory threading spike**: can `ghostty_surface_refresh/draw` be driven from a background TCP-receive thread, or must everything funnel through `@MainActor`? (Geistty/VVTerm both feed on `@MainActor`.) The coalescing-redraw decision + fork viability hinge on this.
- Building the XCFramework needs **Zig + Apple Silicon** at build time → budget build-infra cost upfront.

### 2.3 Reconnect: ET-style replay buffer (chosen over tmux)

- **Eternal Terminal `BackedWriter`**: host keeps a **64MB** circular buffer (`MAX_BACKUP_BYTES`, verified) of PTY output packets tagged with a monotonic **sequence number**. Client reconnects → sends last seq received → host `recover(lastValidSeq)` replays the tail. **Lossless resume**, no UDP, no tmux.
- **Why NOT depend on tmux**: making reconnect *depend* on tmux = a **hard dependency** (host must install tmux + manage named sessions). We **own** the replay buffer → no tmux. (Process survival uses a persistent daemon holding the master FD — [12 §6]; tmux stays a **v2 option** for server-side scrollback + pane mapping, not required.)
- ⚠️ Spike: validate the reconnect handshake through a real iOS background→foreground cycle (incl. `beginBackgroundTask` suspend timing) for byte-exact resume.

### 2.4 Predictive echo: why NOT full Mosh (CHANGE) + glitch-caret (optional)

- Mosh's `PredictionEngine` (speculative local echo on a **shadow VT framebuffer**) makes typing feel "instant" on slow links (mosh.org: median SSH 503ms vs mosh near-instant, EV-DO ~500ms RTT). But:
  1. `ghostty_surface_t` is an **opaque `void*`** (verified — no cell-reading in the C API). Predicting **requires** a **2nd VT parser** maintaining a shadow framebuffer → maintenance burden + **desync** risk (a less-complete parser → mispredictions + jarring snaps).
  2. Mosh **disables prediction in full-screen apps** using cursor positioning (vim/emacs/htop). **Claude Code's TUI also uses alt-screen + cursor positioning** → prediction would be **OFF** inside Claude Code. Benefit only at a **bare shell prompt**.
  3. In **adaptive mode**, Mosh **withholds prediction on fast links** (SRTT_TRIGGER_HIGH=30ms → raw SRTT ~60ms). A 5–20ms mesh RTT → prediction almost always off by Mosh's own design.
- ⚠️ Correction from source: the underline threshold gates on **`send_interval`** (= `ceil(SRTT/2)` clamped to [20,250]ms), **not** raw SRTT; `FLAG_TRIGGER_HIGH=80` ⇒ raw SRTT ~160ms. **CR (0x0d) DOES call `become_tentative()`** (not excluded); only CSI `C`/`D` (←/→) are predicted, every other CSI → tentative.
- **Decision**: no full shadow-framebuffer predictor for v1 — saving 5–20ms only at the shell prompt isn't worth the desync risk. **Cheap option (Phase 2)**: a **glitch-window speculative caret** — track only the **cursor column**, nudge a dim caret when no echo arrives within ~150–250ms ("input received" feedback while Claude Code stalls), no shadow VT parser. 80% of the benefit at ~0 desync risk.
- ⚠️ Spike #1 (decides the above): **measure real end-to-end echo latency on the mesh** (PTY relay → TCP → shell echo → libghostty render) at 5ms and 20ms RTT. This number decides whether a predictor is ever needed.

### 2.5 iOS native feel: table stakes (ADD)

Missing any item → "works" but does **not** feel native (verified from Blink/VVTerm/SwiftTerm):

- **Key-repeat = a manual `DispatchSourceTimer`**: UIKit fires `pressesBegan`/`pressesEnded` **once**, no auto-repeat. Initial delay **350ms**, repeat **50ms** (20Hz) → re-fire the key event. Without it, holding arrow/Delete doesn't repeat.
- **IME proxy = a separate hidden `UITextView`**; do NOT implement `UITextInput` on the same view receiving `pressesBegan` (undefined responder ordering → breaks **CJK**; Claude Code has Japanese users). Ctrl/Alt+letter → `ghostty_surface_key`; everything else via IME proxy → `ghostty_surface_text`.
- **Floating cursor** (`updateFloatingCursor(at:)`): horizontal drag > **5pt** → arrow ←/→ (SwiftTerm verified). On an iPhone without a hardware keyboard, the **only way** to move the cursor. (SwiftTerm gates vertical drag to alt-screen only.)
- **Accessory bar** (Ctrl/Esc/Tab/arrows) shown only when the software keyboard is visible (detect hardware keyboard via keyboard-frame height < ~150pt).
- iOS kills TCP a few seconds after backgrounding → solved by the **ET replay buffer** (§2.3) + `beginBackgroundTask` (`MIN(backgroundTimeRemaining*0.9, 300s)`).

---

## 3. PATH 2 — GUI per-window: best design

> PATH 2 is a pipeline **fully separate** from PATH 1 — don't merge the libghostty surface with video (libghostty only renders its own cell grid).

### 3.1 Capture: SCContentFilter(window:) + NV12 zero-copy + queueDepth

- **`SCContentFilter(window:)`** per-window captures the window's **backing store** → correct even when occluded (verify on macOS 26).
- **`pixelFormat = kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr8BiPlanarVideoRange` (NV12)** → **zero-copy** to `VTCompressionSession`, avoiding BGRA→NV12 (FFmpeg-wrapped paths like Lumen must convert via avcodec). ⚠️ Lumen uses `32BGRA` + captures a **virtual display**, not per-window — don't copy its config.
- **`showsCursor = false`** on `SCStreamConfiguration` → cursor **excluded from the frame** (per-window-correct; do **NOT** use system-wide `CGDisplayHideCursor`). Prerequisite for the client-side cursor (§3.3).
- **queueDepth — real tension, spike it:**
  - [11]/[12] (73-agent latency workflow): default = **8**; use **2–3** for lowest latency (each slot = 1 frame-interval of latency).
  - This workflow: **5** (Sunshine/Apple-sample value); the "3 is the minimum" claim is unverified community inference.
  - **Reconciliation**: 5 is Sunshine-tuned for **60–120fps game-streaming under heavy GPU load**. Our profile = **default 60fps with idle-skip (~0 bandwidth when static), 1 window, HW HEVC ~5–18ms** → release budget `minimumFrameInterval × (queueDepth−1)` at depth-3/60fps = 33ms ≫ 18ms encode → **keep 2–3**. ⚠️ Spike under real GPU contention; if frames drop, raise to 5.
- **Release constraint (verified WWDC22 s10155)**: surfaces must be released within `minimumFrameInterval × (queueDepth−1)`; release the `CMSampleBuffer` surface **immediately** after handing the `CVPixelBuffer` to the encoder.

### 3.2 Encode: VTCompressionSession 4-flag low-latency recipe (ADD/refine)

Native `VTCompressionSession` (NOT an FFmpeg wrapper), HEVC 8-bit 4:2:0 (`kVTProfileLevel_HEVC_Main_AutoLevel`):

- **Specification keys** (set at **session creation**, not via `SetProperty` — common trap):
  - `kVTVideoEncoderSpecification_EnableLowLatencyRateControl = true` — ✅ **verified valid for HEVC on Apple Silicon** (our host). (FFmpeg `videotoolboxenc.c`: `TARGET_CPU_ARM64 && AV_CODEC_ID_HEVC`.)
  - `kVTVideoEncoderSpecification_RequireHardwareAcceleratedVideoEncoder = true` — hard-fail instead of silently dropping to software.
- **Property keys** (via `VTSessionSetProperty`): `RealTime=true`, `ExpectedFrameRate=60`, `PrioritizeEncodingSpeedOverQuality=true` (Apple's 4-flag recipe), `AllowFrameReordering=false` (no B-frames), `MaxKeyFrameInterval=INT_MAX` (IDR on-demand).
- ⚠️ **Corrections vs doc 09/DECISIONS**:
  - `MaxFrameDelayCount=0` and `AllowOpenGOP=false` are **not verified as part of the SDK recipe** — harmless, but don't claim they're Apple standard. Keep as belt-and-suspenders, mark for verification.
  - **`EnableLowLatencyRateControl` requires a target bitrate** (bitrate-based, not constant-quality). ✅ **RESOLVED by measurement ([18 §0]):** live frames use **low-latency-RC** (measured 7.5ms), NOT constant-quality (measured 24ms, too slow). Crisp-upgrade moves to a separate **Session B** with `Quality=1.0` all-intra. (2 sessions, one rate-controller each.)
  - **Do NOT set `max_ref_frames=1` for H.264** (verified in Sunshine `video.cpp`): on Apple Silicon VT H.264 it turns **every frame into an IDR** → ~3× bandwidth. HEVC unaffected (safe). Trap if H.264 is tried later.
  - **Don't query `UsingHardwareAcceleratedVideoEncoder` while low-latency mode is on** (returns -12900).

### 3.3 Client-side cursor rendering — the HIGHEST-impact technique (ADD)

Confirmed **by 3 families** (Parsec, Moonlight, Selkies). The single "feels remote" ↔ "feels local" differentiator:

1. Host: `showsCursor=false` (cursor never enters the video) — §3.1.
2. Host: sample `NSEvent` mouse position at ~**120Hz**; send **position (host-space CGPoint) + shape (`NSCursor` image + hotspot)** over a **dedicated <64-byte UDP socket**, **NOT** multiplexed onto the video socket (shared → video backpressure delays the cursor).
3. Client: composite the cursor as a **Metal quad / `CALayer`** on top of the decoded frame, at **display-refresh**.
- ⟹ **Pointer latency = pure RTT** (5–20ms), decoupled from encode/decode (typically 30–50ms).
- ⚠️ Correction: the Parsec patent is **US 9,798,436** (survey had it wrong). moonlight-qt only toggles `SDL_ShowCursor()`, no dedicated cursor-shape side-channel — the full pattern comes from **Selkies**.
- ⚠️ Spike: confirm `showsCursor=false` **actually** removes the cursor from the per-window `CMSampleBuffer` on target macOS (it may already be composited into the IOSurface).

### 3.4 Lossy-first → lossless-upgrade — sharp text for editors (ADD)

Solves "fast vs readable" for coding (extends "4:4:4 dropped, sharp text only via PTY" — now **GUI windows also get pixel-perfect text** once the user stops):

1. On each `SCFrameStatus.complete`: encode with **Session A low-latency-RC** (NOT constant-quality) and send **immediately** → first frame ~RTT. 📏 **Measured on M1 Max ([18 §0]): low-latency-RC 7.5ms vs constant-quality 0.65 = 24ms** → live frames must use low-latency-RC.
2. Accumulate the **dirty-rect union**; start a `DispatchSourceTimer` (GCD) with a **~200–600ms** delay = `max(batch_delay×5, 200ms)`. ⚠️ **NOT 1000ms** — that's Xpra's `LOCKED_BATCH_DELAY` for iconic/idle windows, not the refresh timer.
3. New frame before the timer fires → **cancel & reschedule** (Xpra's `cancel_refresh_timer`).
4. Timer fires after true idle → re-encode the dirty union. **Update [18 E]: use a SEPARATE SESSION (Session B)**, all-intra `Quality=1.0`+`AllowTemporalCompression=false` (don't cram into the live session — low-latency-RC needs a bitrate, conflicting with constant-quality). Encode as an **INTRA slice** → UDP loss of the upgrade can't corrupt decode state.
5. **Window chrome** (title/scroll bar, height < ~40px) → always lossless on the first pass.
- ⚠️ Spike: confirm `kVTCompressionPropertyKey_Lossless` availability + measure lossless frame size for a 1080p editor window (to size the UDP send queue).

### 3.5 Idle-skip + damage tracking (refine)

- In `didOutputSampleBuffer` read `SCStreamFrameInfo.status`; if `== .idle` → **return immediately** (no IOSurface, no encode, no send). **Zero-cost damage check** (≡ X11 DAMAGE DeltaRectangles); keeps the **encoder slot free** so the next real frame (keystroke) gets HW immediately. >90% of frames in a coding session are static.
- Heartbeat **IDR ~every 1s** on an idle window (so a reconnecting/loss-recovering client catches a frame).

### 3.6 Transport + loss: UDP seq + FEC + LTR (refine)

> Packet seq, FEC + frame reassembly, LTR/recovery admission, congestion/ABR are native Swift (`SlopDeskVideoProtocol`); the video host/client own capture, the socket, and the HW codec.

- Plain UDP over the trusted mesh (no DTLS/QUIC — WireGuard is already ChaCha20-Poly1305; inner crypto is pure overhead). A **4-byte sequence number/packet** for ordering/loss detection.
- **Reed-Solomon FEC at ~20% parity/frame** (Sunshine's default).
- **Prefer LTR-frame recovery over forced IDR**: `kVTCompressionPropertyKey_EnableLTR` + `ForceLTRRefresh` on loss → avoids the keyframe bandwidth/latency spike. Needs a small **client→host ACK channel** (cheap at our RTT), IDR fallback after a 2-RTT timeout. ⚠️ Correction: invalidation direction is **client→server** (client sends the RFI range; server marks the ref frame invalid).
- Cap the encode queue at **2–3 frames in flight**; drop oldest; **never** backpressure SCKit's callback thread.

### 3.7 Client frame pacing (ADD)

- Drive client display from **`CADisplayLink` (VSync)**, NOT decode completion. Empty queue → **hold the last decoded frame** (Moonlight pacer: `TIMER_SLACK ~3ms`, time-critical thread). Late frames are **skipped**, not queued → no latency accumulation.
- Decode session `RealTime=true`; **`CVMetalTextureCache`** for zero-copy CVPixelBuffer→Metal; **`CAMetalLayer.maximumDrawableCount=2`** keeps display latency ~1 vsync.
- ⚠️ Spike: measure `VTDecompressionSession` decode latency on a real Apple Silicon client — confirm **single-frame**, no silent 2-frame buffering (`RealTime=true` does **not** guarantee this) → decides whether the 60fps motion-to-photon budget holds.

### 3.8 Window-geometry metadata channel (ADD)

A **dedicated** metadata channel carrying window **move/resize/title** → the client `NSWindow` repositions **immediately, before the next video frame**. Every per-window solution (RDP RemoteApp/RAIL, X11, Xpra) has one. ⚠️ RAIL correction (MS-RDPERP §1.3.2.5): mouse-driven moves do **not** send a Client-Window-Move PDU — only the mouse-button-up is sent, the server infers position; the PDU is only needed for keyboard-driven moves.

### 3.9 Input: CGEvent + coordinate-mapping RISK (KEEP + PATH 2 spike #1)

- `CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, ...)` for clicks/keys (Accessibility granted before launch; non-sandboxed; outside MAS — [06]). `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` for absolute moves. **Tag every event with `eventSourceUserData`** so the host filters self-injected events (avoiding loops).
- **Mouse-move coalescing**: drain pending moves, accumulate deltas, send once (Moonlight's `SDL_PeepEvents`).
- ✅ **Coordinate mapping = SOLVED ([18 B]):** `kCGWindowBounds` (CG top-left)→normalize→`postToPid` (needs TCC **"Post Event"**); fix multi-monitor by **flipping to Cocoa space** (`primaryH − y − h`) before `NSScreen.frame.intersection` to get the correct `backingScaleFactor`; window-move = AX `kAXWindowMovedNotification` (fires at END) + poll `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` during the drag. Tag `eventSourceUserData` to filter self-injection.
- **Background input:** decided as **activate-then-control, 1 window at a time (must focus)** → target window becomes frontmost → `CGEventPost` is universal (every app), avoiding the SkyLight private API. ([18 A])

### 3.10 Concurrent window limit (ADD constraint)

- **2–4 simultaneous HEVC HW `VTCompressionSession`s** on Apple Silicon before dropping to software → the **upper bound on simultaneous remote GUI windows**. ⚠️ Spike to benchmark the exact number on target hardware.
- 1 `VTCompressionSession` per tracked window (keeps encoder state across frames; avoids waypipe's per-buffer flicker bug).

## 4. Native-feel techniques — ranked by impact

| Technique | Path | Impact | Effort |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **Client-side cursor** (strip + UDP side-channel + composite at refresh) | GUI | **High** — pointer = RTT, decoupled from codec; the local/remote boundary | Medium |
| **`TCP_NODELAY`** on every PATH 1 socket | TUI | **High** — Nagle can add +200ms/keystroke | Trivial |
| **libghostty external-IO** over raw TCP | TUI | **High** — full fidelity, event-driven redraw, 0 round-trips | Medium-high (own fork) |
| **`SCFrameStatus.idle` skip** + heartbeat IDR | GUI | **High** — >90% of frames static; keeps the encoder slot free | Low |
| **Lossy-first → lossless-upgrade** | GUI | **High** — fast + pixel-perfect text on pause | Medium |
| **VideoToolbox 4-flag low-latency + NV12 zero-copy** | GUI | **High** — encode ~5–18ms, no reorder, no BGRA conversion | Medium |
| **ET replay buffer** for reconnect | TUI | **High** — byte-exact resume through iOS backgrounding | Medium |
| **CADisplayLink pacing + show-last-frame** | GUI | Medium-high — no judder, latency ~1 vsync | Low-medium |
| **iOS UIKit table stakes** (key-repeat/IME/floating-cursor/accessory) | TUI | Medium-high — "works" → "native iOS" | Medium |
| **Dual data/control channels** | TUI | Medium — output bursts don't delay resize | Low |
| **Glitch-window speculative caret** (cursor column) | TUI | Medium — feedback during stalls, ~0 desync risk | Low |
| **LTR + ~20% Reed-Solomon FEC** instead of forced IDR | GUI | Medium — avoids spikes; near-irrelevant at mesh loss rates but ~0 cost, hardens WiFi | Medium |
| **QoS `USER_INTERACTIVE`** on PTY-relay & capture+encode threads | both | Medium — keeps the latency-critical path scheduled first | Trivial |

## 5. Gap analysis vs current decisions

> **KEEP** = correct. **CHANGE** = fix/clarify. **ADD** = new. (Pushed into [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).)

**PATH 1**
- KEEP — raw VT bytes over plain TCP + libghostty; no app-level crypto; input = bytes→PTY stdin.
- CHANGE — no full Mosh predictor for v1 (opaque ghostty → duplicate parser; benefit only at shell prompt). Glitch-caret is a Phase 2 option.
- CHANGE — libghostty external-IO **exists only in forks** (wiedymi `custom-io` / daiimus `ios-external-backend`); our own patch is a tracked dependency.
- ADD — `TCP_NODELAY`; ET 64MB seq replay buffer (over tmux); dual data/control channels; QoS USER_INTERACTIVE relay; iOS UIKit table stakes.

**PATH 2**
- KEEP — `SCContentFilter(window:)`; HEVC 8-bit 4:2:0; plain UDP; default 60fps + idle-skip (~0 bandwidth when static); CGEvent injection (accepting Accessibility/non-sandbox/outside-MAS).
- CHANGE — **`EnableLowLatencyRateControl` MEASURED for HEVC on Apple Silicon** (7.5ms; CQ 24ms too slow → live = low-latency-RC, crisp = Session B). queueDepth: keep **2–3** (latency) not Sunshine's 5, with a spike.
- ADD — client-side cursor (highest impact); 4-flag recipe + RequireHWEncoder + NV12 zero-copy; lossy-first→lossless-upgrade; CADisplayLink pacing; LTR+FEC instead of forced IDR; window-geometry channel; coordinate mapping as risk #1; 2–4 concurrent VTCompressionSession limit.

---

## 6. Open spikes → **mostly resolved, see [18](18-risk-resolutions.md)**

The 8 first-draft spikes were researched to solutions + skeptic-verified ([18]): #2 threading, #3 coordinate, #7 reconnect, #8 rate-control = **SOLVED**; #5 cursor-strip, #4 decode, #6 concurrent-encoder = **BOUNDED** (spikes with decision rules). What remained was **measurement on hardware** (now done — [18 §0]):

1. **Real PATH 1 echo latency on the mesh** at 5ms & 20ms RTT → decides whether a predictor is needed. *(most important for PATH 1; needs measurement)*
2. **SPIKE F** decode→display p99 < 1 frame (16.7ms@60fps) on a real client.
3. **SPIKE G** N HW `VTCompressionSession`s per chip @1080p/1440p → concurrent-window bound.
4. **SPIKE D** `showsCursor=false` cleanly strips the per-window cursor (window on-screen).

> **Old risk #1 (CGEvent coordinates / background input) is gone:** the **activate-then-control, 1 window at a time** decision ([18 A]) eliminates the SkyLight private API + the Chromium background failure + macOS 26 fragility.
