# 60 — hostd becomes a Rust process

The continuation of `docs/59-hostd-projection.md`. That document moved hostd's *decisions* into Rust
crates while the process stayed Swift; steps 1–9 are landed. This one moves the *process*. When it is
done `Sources/SlopDeskHost` and the host half of `Sources/SlopDeskTransport` are deleted, and the
two-language codec debt that `DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-13 opened — and said "its only honest retirement
is finishing the port" — is retired for the host end.

Read `docs/59` §5 and §6 first. This document CORRECTS one line of §6.

## 1. The correction: `MuxNWConnection` is not Network.framework

`docs/59` §6 lists `Sources/SlopDeskTransport/Mux/MuxNWConnection.swift` as "837 lines of
Network.framework… for as long as hostd is a Swift process". Measured on this tree, that is wrong in
the way that matters: the file is 847 lines and **does not `import Network`**. Its imports are
`Foundation` and `SlopDeskProtocol`; it is generic over `any MuxByteLink`, and the tests already
drive it through an `InMemoryMuxLink`. It is IO *orchestration*, not framework binding — portable by
the same rule everything else in `docs/59` moved under.

The real Network.framework surface in this repo is four files, 863 lines:

| file | lines | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HostTransport.swift` | 494 | the `NWListener`, accept loop, CONTROL/DATA pairing |
| `Mux/NWMuxByteLink.swift` | 193 | `MuxByteLink` over one `NWConnection` |
| `NWConnection+Async.swift` | 110 | `send`/`receive` continuations |
| `TransportParameters.swift` | 66 | the `NWParameters` every socket is built from |

And what those parameters ask for is plain TCP:

```swift
tcp.noDelay = true                    // TCP_NODELAY, mandatory
tcp.enableKeepalive = true
tcp.keepaliveIdle = 10; tcp.keepaliveInterval = 5; tcp.keepaliveCount = 3
NWParameters(tls: nil, tcp: tcp)      // no app crypto, raw bytes over WireGuard
```

No TLS, no QUIC, no Bonjour, no multipath, peer-to-peer disabled. Every one of those five knobs is
`std::net::TcpListener` plus `socket2::TcpKeepalive::{with_time, with_interval, with_retries}` and
`set_nodelay`. **So there is no Apple binding on hostd's transport path at all** — no `objc2` crate,
no `unsafe`, and nothing in the `slopdesk-apple-*` family. `socket2` is rust-lang's own crate, which
is the "prefer a maintained library" answer for the three keepalive sockopts that would otherwise be
three hand-written `setsockopt` calls in `slopdesk-posix`.

The floor §6 drew was real when it was drawn — it was drawn around a *linked-library* port, where
Swift keeps the runloop. It does not survive the process moving.

## 2. What is actually left in Swift on the host

`Sources/SlopDeskHost` is 20,572 lines across its files (comments included; `docs/59`'s ~10.5k is the
code-line count). Exactly **six** files touch an Apple framework or `Darwin`:

| file | lines | pinned on | where it goes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RepoStatusWatcher.swift` | 316 | CoreServices (FSEvents) | new `slopdesk-apple-fsevents` |
| `AgentHookListener.swift` | 251 | `Darwin` (sockets) | `slopdesk-posix` / plain `std` |
| `HostMetadataProbe.swift` | 133 | `Darwin` (sysctl) | `slopdesk-posix` |
| `HostClipboardPerformer.swift` | 129 | AppKit (`NSPasteboard`) | new `slopdesk-apple-pasteboard` |
| `HostPathActionPerformer.swift` | 97 | AppKit (`NSWorkspace`) | `slopdesk-apple-app` (extend) |
| `PTYProcess.swift` | 753 | `Darwin` (fd, termios) | `slopdesk-posix` (already has `pty`) |

1,679 lines, of which the genuinely Apple-framework part is 542 and the genuinely `objc2` part is
226. Everything else in the directory is decisions, ladders and timers — and the decisions are
already Rust (`slopdesk-muxsession`, 7,071 lines, `docs/59` steps 1–9).

`PTYProcess` deserves its own line: hostd does not fork. superd forks and keeps the master; hostd
holds a `SCM_RIGHTS` duplicate and does the read loop, resize and teardown on it. `slopdesk-posix`
already owns the fork window and `pty::window_size`; superd already owns the fd-passing. Porting
this file is fd plumbing between two things that are Rust already.

## 3. The threading model: threads, not a runtime

Every sidecar in this tree is blocking `std` on threads — `slopdesk-superd` serves a `UnixListener`
with a thread per connection, and **no crate in `rust/` depends on tokio, smol, async-std or
futures**. hostd follows them. That is a deliberate choice and not an omission:

- The concurrency is bounded and known — two sockets per client connection, a read thread per socket,
  a thread per pane's PTY read loop. It is tens of threads, not tens of thousands.
- `docs/59` §7's constraint is *zero allocations added per chunk*. A blocking read into a reused
  buffer meets it by construction; an async runtime's poll machinery does not obviously.
- Adding tokio would make it the largest dependency in the tree and would fight the six existing
  daemons' shape for no measured gain.

`docs/59` §6 keeps "the `Task`s and the timeouts — every ladder step answers WHAT to do and WHEN to
arm a timer under which generation; Swift arms it". Under a process port there is no Swift to arm
them. Each ladder's timer becomes an explicit deadline on a thread, and the *generation* check that
made the Swift version correct is carried across verbatim rather than re-derived — a generation-stale
timer firing is the failure this design is shaped to prevent, in either language.

## 4. The stages

Each stage lands green on its own, is committed on its own, and keeps `golden/golden_vectors.json`
as its gate. No stage leaves the tree unable to run.

**Stage A — the socket.** New crate `rust/slopdesk-hostnet`: `TcpListener` + `socket2` parameters +
CONTROL/DATA pairing by `connectionID`, and a `ByteLink` trait matching `MuxByteLink`'s contract so
the in-memory test double ports with it. Deliverable: a Rust process that accepts a real Swift
client's two sockets and reads mux frames off them through `slopdesk-wire::mux`. Gate: a loopback
test driving the shipping Swift client against it.

**Stage B — the mux connection.** `MuxNWConnection` (847) + `MuxSubChannel` (426) +
`ConnectionRegistry` (316) + `MuxRouter`/`MuxRoutingCore`/`MuxAdmission` (287) + `ReplayBuffer` (441)
→ `slopdesk-muxsession::connection`. The routing verdicts are already there; this is the receive
loops, the per-channel dispatch tables and the flow-control accounting around them.

**Stage C — the pane.** `PTYProcess` (753) + `PaneOutputStream` (402) + `MuxChannelSession` (4,108)
→ the ladders over `slopdesk-muxsession`'s existing `outbox`/`fanout`/`truths`/`lifecycle`. This is
the largest single stage and the one `docs/59` §7's A/B harness exists for: 20,000 32-KiB chunks
through `ingestPTYChunk` on both sides before it is committed.

**Stage D — the server.** `HostServer` (3,134) + `HostSessionRegistry` + `HostLifecycleRules` +
`DetachedSessionStore` + `SupervisedServiceLifecycle`/`Process` + `CodeServerManager` +
`CodeBridgeServer` + `AgentControlListener` + `MetadataResponseBuilder` + the workspace channel.

**Stage E — the Apple residue.** `slopdesk-apple-pasteboard` (NSPasteboard), `NSWorkspace` into
`slopdesk-apple-app`, `slopdesk-apple-fsevents` (FSEvents). `docs/57`'s bar, `objc2` only, a leak
test each. `PreventSleepDriver`/`slopdesk-apple-power` is the shape.

FSEvents is a CoreFoundation C API, not Objective-C, so "is it reachable through `objc2` at all" was
checked rather than assumed: **`objc2-core-services` 0.3.2** — the same version family as the
`objc2-core-foundation = "=0.3.2"` every crate in the family already pins — generates
`FSEventStreamCreate`, `FSEventStreamSetDispatchQueue`, `FSEventStreamStart` and
`FSEventStreamRelease` in `generated/FSEvents.rs`. They are `unsafe extern "C-unwind"` rather than
safe wrappers, which is what `slopdesk-apple-cgwindow` and `-cgdisplay` already deal with, and the
callback's borrowed `FSEventStreamRef` is a Get-rule pointer — `CFRetained::retain`, one of `docs/57`'s
two named admissions. So the crate stays inside the family and no third `unsafe` crate is proposed.
The `notify` crate would also work and is better maintained, but it is not `objc2`, so it would have
to live outside `slopdesk-apple-*`; that trade is not worth taking for one watcher when the bindings
exist.

**Stage F — the cutover.** `Sources/slopdesk-hostd/main.swift` (382) becomes
`rust/slopdesk-hostd`; `make host-restart` and `slopdesk-hostlaunch` retarget; `Sources/SlopDeskHost`
and the host half of `Sources/SlopDeskTransport` are DELETED, with their tests ported to the crates
that now hold the behaviour.

**Stage G (separate campaign, not scoped here) — the client transport.** `Sources/SlopDeskProtocol`
and `MuxNWConnection` survive stage F because the macOS/iOS clients still speak through them. Moving
those behind `CSlopDeskFFI` is a linked-library port under `CLAUDE.md`'s lifetime rule, not a socket
one, and it is what finally deletes the second copy of the codec.

**What stage F does NOT delete, said plainly.** The consumer grep is unambiguous:
`MuxNWConnection`, `MuxSubChannel`, `ConnectionRegistry` and `ReplayBuffer` are imported by
`SlopDeskClient`, `ClientComposition`, `WorkspaceStore`, `WorkspaceChannelClient` and
`VideoConnectionRegistry` — the CLIENT, on both platforms. So stage B does not move that code, it
adds a second implementation of it, and the second copy lives until stage G. Stage F deletes
`Sources/SlopDeskHost` and the host-only half of `SlopDeskTransport` (`HostTransport`,
`NWMuxByteLink`, `NWConnection+Async`, `TransportParameters`); it leaves the mux connection standing
for the clients. Anyone reading "the host port deletes the transport" should read this paragraph
instead.

## 5. The carve-out, said out loud

`CLAUDE.md`: "One implementation, never two languages. Porting means deleting the original in the
same change." Stages A–E cannot obey that literally — a process cutover has one switch, at stage F,
and until it is thrown the Swift hostd must keep running. This is the same carve-out
`DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-13 recorded for the wire codec, on the same bound and with the same honest
retirement: **the new Rust is linked by nothing shipping until stage F**, and the golden corpus is a
gate both implementations must pass, so they cannot drift silently. If this campaign stalls, the
correct move is to delete the unlanded crates, not to keep two hosts.

## 6. The floor that survives

- `TIOCSWINSZ` on hostd's duplicate — one writer, still hostd's. `PaneResizeFold`'s line is unchanged.
- `tcgetpgrp`/`tcgetattr` — no polled IPC for the foreground process group. They move to
  `slopdesk-posix`, they do not move to superd.
- `golden/golden_vectors.json` — never regenerated over, at any stage.
- superd owns `read` on every PTY master; hostd reads its own duplicate and nothing else.
- No app-layer crypto or auth. `tls: nil` becomes "we never call a TLS library", not "we add one".

## 7. The invariant rules that move with the stages

`make lint-invariants` ratchets two rules onto files this campaign deletes. Each moves in the stage
that empties its file, with its break test, and neither is a reason to keep the Swift:

- **`one-frame-one-doorman`** (`rules/hot_paths.rs:709`) — `Claim::Exists` + `Claim::Doors` on
  `MuxAdmission.swift`, and `Claim::Doors` + `Claim::NoneOf { maxChannelsPerConnection }` on
  `MuxNWConnection.swift`. It says the four-guard precedence has one owner and the connection asks
  rather than re-derives. **Stage B** re-points every claim at the Rust connection and its doorman
  call sites; the claim it encodes is unchanged, only the language it is checked in.
- **`one-nwconnection-byte-channel`** (`rules/transport_lanes.rs:290`) — scoped to `SlopDeskNet`,
  the inspector event lane and PATH-4 file transfer. **Untouched by this campaign**; those lanes are
  not hostd's mux and keep their Swift channel.

`rules/apple_floors.rs` pins injection, the window list and capture — none of the six hostd files
above. Stage E adds a row to it per new crate, the way `slopdesk-apple-power` did.
